# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) â€“ C++ Implementation  

This repository serves as a structured collection of **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** implementations in C++, designed for efficient learning and practice. It covers fundamental and advanced topics, making it a valuable resource for students and professionals preparing for technical interviews and academic coursework.  

## ðŸ“Œ Topics Covered  

### **Data Structures**  
- **Arrays** (Sorted, Unsorted)  
- **Linked Lists** (Sorted, Unsorted)  
- **Stacks** (Array-based & Linked List-based)  
- **Queues** (Array-based & Linked List-based)  
- **Binary Search Trees (BST)**  
- **Graph Algorithms** (BFS, DFS)  
- **Heap & Priority Queues**  
- **Recursion & Dynamic Programming**  

### **Algorithms**  
- **0/1 Knapsack** (Recursion & Dynamic Programming)  
- **Huffman Coding Compression Algorithm**  

### **Examples & Applications**  
- **Infix to Postfix Conversion**  
- **Point Problem Analysis**  

This repository is part of my **university coursework**, where I have implemented these concepts with efficiency in mind. Feel free to explore, ask questions, and contribute.
